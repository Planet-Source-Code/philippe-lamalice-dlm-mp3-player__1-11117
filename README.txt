DLM MP3 PLAYER -- BY PHILIPPE LAMALICE
======================================

Here are included all sources and controls
used by DLM MP3 Player.

The player is still "BETA" and might show up
bugs. (like one I know  --> the MiniBrowser
browsing window only appears after you open
the MiniBrowser twice)

Coding is also kind of messy but my first
matter was to make it work, and since i've
been writting this program for about a month
now (about 1 hour a day), I haven't had time
to simplify and clean up my codes.

Comments are also limited since i didn't
tought I was going to distribute the sources!

Hope you like my playa !
